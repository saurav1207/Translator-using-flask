# Translator-using-flask

Hey folks,

I have created an Al-based translator which can translate any sentence from one language to any other by using the flask framework under the guidance of Abhinav Sharma sir

There was an amazing session hosted on our campus at Jaipur Engineering College and Research Centre (JECRC) on 1st April 2022 by our respected seniors Vilsi Jain ma'am, Aditi Gupta ma'am, and Abhinav Sharma sir

Topics covered in the session were:-

1). Open-source and GitHub which was taken by Vilsi Jain ma'am.

2). Cloud computing and Microsoft Azure which was taken by Aditi Gupta ma'am.

3). Deploying application by using Flask. which was taken by Abhinav Sharma sir.

It was a memorable session at JECRC Foundation, got great deep insights and learned a lot about the topic through that amazing session.

Looking forward to deep diving into the technology & create more such interesting projects in the future.

Hoping to witness more such exciting workshops at our campus.
